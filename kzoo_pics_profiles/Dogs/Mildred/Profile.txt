She may be the size of a teaspoon but her personality is the size of an apartment block.  Yes, still looking for her forever home, I'm amazed she hasn't been snapped up, she's such a character.

 

Mildred will bring a smile to anyone's face and light up your day just by being in the room.  A very sweet, friendly 5 years old little girl.
